# TJ's configuration

I use VIM a lot, so there are probably some things that lead more to a vim-like style.

The map can be seen in keymap.c

Key points:

- `LCTRL` and `Z` keys have been switched
- Holding `X` will give you `LCTRL + LSHFT`. This gives you control and control-shift right next to you each other. Easy navigation without stretching.
- Layer 3:
  - Window / workspace manager.
  - Navigate with vim's `hjkl`.
  - Hold `E` to use `SHIFT` and therefore move windows between the different workspaces
